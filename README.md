# Flashcard-Generator

Allows users to create two types of flashcards.

Basic flashcards which have a front ("What is the year?") and a back ("2017").

Cloze-Deleted flashcards which present partial text ("The year is ____") and the full text when the user requests it ("The year is 2017").


BasicCard("Who was the first president of the United States?", "George Washington");
ClozeCard("George Washington was the first president of the United States.", "George Washington");
